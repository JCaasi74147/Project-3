IMPORTANT:

Use start.bat or start.sh to start the program. It should automatically open the web page for the application.
Potential issues:
* ensure that actor-movie-data.zip is unzipped; the resultant file 'actor-movie-data.csv'
  should be in the same directory as main.cpp, graph.cpp, etc.
* if the link differs from what's in the batch/shell file, just check the terminal the script is running on
  for the correct link.
